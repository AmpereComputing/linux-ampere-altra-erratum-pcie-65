Per Altra family erratum, PCIE_65 may cause invalid addresses to be generated
on PCIe mmio writes, impacting certain device types, notably AMD GPUs, and thus
the Altra family is not generally compatible with those device types. We have
provided a proof-of-concept software patch under the GPL v2 that will allow
experimental and development work to proceed.  PER THE TERMS OF THAT LICENSE
AND AS A REMINDER, NO WARRANTIES OR SUPPORT IS PROVIDED.

The patches for a particular kernel version are located in the directory with
that version's name.
